This is my capstone project for my senior year in SEP12.
So I am writing these entries to document my progression during my independent study.
What I want to do is to be able to create games because I am an avid gamer and one day I would like to create my own game that people want to play. So, I decided to split my time between Java and Gosu for the first week. Gosu is for creating games using a library, from my understanding. Java is a coding language that mainly focuses on the backend and is used for Android applications. Almost immediately I came to a fork in a road! I Love games and making a game is one of my dreams, but I also wanted to make an android app because my phone is an android and I thought it would be cool to have an app I built in my phone. Both are hard to understand, so during week 2, I will conduct more research and finalize my decision.
