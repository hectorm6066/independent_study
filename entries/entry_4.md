# Entry 4
##### Updates
So, since my last entry, I have been experimenting a lot more in the sandbox. I have started to experiment with Volume control and how the set effects work. I think I have gotten better and I am going to continue experimenting into spring break and the week after. After those 2 weeks, I am going to start working on 1 song and center it around a genre. I still have yet to choose my favorite genre, so I am going to be debating it over the next 2 weeks.
### Example
### Thoughts
I have several thoughts about this week. 
### Takeaways
- Always **experiment**, follow along with the guides if there are any, but copy and paste the code and try something different out.
- Don't be afraid to ask your friends for their opinions. I always ask my friends on how it sounds so I can see how the music should flow.
