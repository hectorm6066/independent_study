# Entry 7
### Updates
Since last week, I now have an MVP(Minimum Viable Product) ready for the final project. Its not perfect yet, but I believe it is good enough to be presented if I had to right now.
### Thoughts
The project has gone through many different phases since it was conceived. I originally intended for the project to be rock and roll, but I decided that there was way too soundfiles to sift through. I then went through a funk phase, but even then, I could not make a comprehensible song that didn't sound like jumbled garbage. I then moved on to the final phase of my music, I decided to do electro since I was listening to it more and understood how the music is supposed to go.
### Takeaways
* **Don't be afraid** to start over from scratch if you are unsatisfied with your work, just be sure to work twice as hard to make up for it.
* It is okay to change the focus of your project, this project is about you creating something that **you** are proud of.
