# Entry 5

#### Update
So far I have experimented further with volume gain and I think I will be using it in my final project. I have also decided on a genre for my final project, so I am ready to begin construction on my final project. Everything has been going mostly smooth, with some minor bugs and bad inputs into my code. However, my ear buds had broke at the start of the week and Ive been relying on only 1 side to listen to my work at school. I decided I would get a new pair soon so I can work at 100%.
#### What I learned
I learned about how volume gain can really help my music with how it sounds. Instead of a blaring electro bit of music overshadowing the beat, I can boost the beat and lower the electro so that it becomes the background.
#### Thoughts
I am kind of sad that one of my ear buds died when I am doing a sound oriented project. But thankfully, I plan on getting a high quality pair, but they won't arrive for atleast a few days. Luckily, I can work at home because I won't be bothering anyone.
#### Takeaways
- One takeaway I had was to take my own notes instead of reading directly from the guide. Although the guide is next to my work and it is helpful, I often forget where to find a specific example or code snippet.
- Don't rely on one object all the time. My ear buds broke and I had no spares to go on, so I had to order a new pair and wait while they arrived. **Always have a backup plan.**
