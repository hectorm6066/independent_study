# Entry 6

### Updates
Since the last entry, I have made significant progress on my final project. I have been experimenting with functions and it looks like my project will be ready for the expo which is in a few weeks.
### Thoughts
So I have been thinking about the final product of my project. When I present it, what if the people don't like my taste of music? What if they think it is bad? These are questions that have been bothering me for the better part of 2 weeks. I have been asking around, trying to see what kind of music my classmates like. But I think I will settle on making electro music.
