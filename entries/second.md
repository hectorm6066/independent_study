<h1>Entry 2</h1>
I decided to do earsketch instead of working on gosu or java. I was very literally pulling my hair out trying to get gosu to work and I decided against learning it. It was so frustrating to use and in the end I still could not get the library to work. I decided to try earsketch on Thursday because I had some spare time and I quite enjoy music in my freetime. Earsketch has proved so far to be very fun and I quite enjoy working on it. It uses python and javascript, both of which I learned before so this project should be a bit easier on my mind. Though I still need to relaern some aspects and follow the guide provided to me by Earsketch to improve my music.
